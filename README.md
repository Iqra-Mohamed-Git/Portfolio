# CISC 480 - Senior Capstone Portfolio

## Overview
This repository serves as a portfolo made up of three projects completed 
during my time at Macalester College and University of St. Thomas. Each 
project higlights different skills I learned throught my time in both schools.

## Project 1 - MacEvents
I chose this project because it demonstrates my ability to solve a real world problem.
There wasn't any way to be notified about events happening on Macalester College campus 
without going to the website, so we solved that with making an app.

## Project 2 - St. Paul Crime Data Web Application
I chose this project because it demonstrates my ability to build a single page application
with multiple API's. Also was my first time using Vue.js framework.

## Project 3 - DRAG: An Ergonomic Writing Utensil
I chose this project because it was one of the few times I have wroked with 3D printing.
It relates to St. Thomas vison because it includes accesbility.
